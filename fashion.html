            <p>People who are tall tend to think of themselves as walking trees. However, WEquance thinks of the tall as queens and that we embrace their tall attributes. No one should feel shameful of their body type, regardless if they're short or small. The height or width of a woman doesn't define them and WE are here to show them that. Nonetheless, we have links for the gorgeously tall, so they can feel even more beautiful when dressing themselves! </p>
