           <p>The art of mathematics is simple. Receive a problem, give an answer. The beauty of it is, is that mathematics can have multiple answers and that the more answers there are, the more we learn about the subject itself. Women are just as cognitive and intelligent as men, so with more smart women in this field, we can learn more about the field. Mathematics is education and education starts with women.</p>

          <p>Women are frequently seen in the talent of literature and the art of the english language. They have shaped the language and culture into what we see today and that the advances we see and examine in the language, is thoroughly impacted by the female gender. Without them, literature would be drastically different and not as flawless as we see today. By reading and further exploring the effects of the women of literature, you can recognize their help and their significance in general. WE believe women shape the future, the past, and today.</p>

          <p>Throughout the world of economics, we see mostly men portrayed in the media!! However, there are countless groups of women pursuing this background and field. Because women have so much to offer, we need to expose these gifts to humanity in the media! Without talented, intelligent women economics can't be more effectively impacted in a positive perspective. Only women can do this and that women impact our economy more than most know. Help recognize and further cherish them as well! Women are integral and crucial. They are beautiful and intelligent. We need more women.</p>

          <p>History is defined as the past and what shapes the future. Throughout our history here on this planet, we have underwent groundbreaking times and settings. However, many of these situations have only came from women. For example, Marie Curie had invented radioactivity which fuels energy and reshapes warfare today. Furthermore, Eleanor Roosevelt was a campaigner for civil rights and gave women the power to speak for what they believe in and strengthened our beliefs that integrity is real. Without women in history, men would become more powerful than women and we can't have that, right? Women are the history. They are the future. They are the present.
